I'm a former Quality Assurance Engineer who has taken the plunge into the world of coding. The QA roles I've held stoked my curiosity and interest in what actually goes on under the coding hood. Recently I have graduated from Makers Academy, a 16 week intensive coding bootcamp and I am now actively consolidating and stretching myself to become a proficient full stack developer.  

Since 2015, I have forged a career as a QA, have taught myself to touch type, and have learnt the basics of the dark arts of coding. My goal is to unleash my inner coding ninja and in so doing releasing the creative and effective potential within me so that I can build cool and interesting stuff. My desire is to be building and supporting web and mobile projects that I can be proud of and that will make a real difference to those around me.

## Skills

#### Attention to detail
As a QA at Collinson Tech and Zopa, I have demonstrated a keen eye for detail which has helped me to detect and prevent bugs and regression from affecting the applications. My QA experience has helped me to hone this skill and has given me a great foundation for life as a developer. Together with the strong foundation I have built at Makers, this skill has only become sharper.


#### Strong desire for self improvement
In 2014, I made a decision to move into the world of programming. Through self learning I grasped the basics of HTML, CSS and SQL and within a year I had secured my first QA job. Being self motivated has been the foundation for the upward learning curve I've been on since my first IT job as a junior QA in 2015. Since then I've been driven to continue learning and completing the Makers Academy bootcamp has helped to accelerate this process.


#### Communication
At Lloyds Bank I started in a role in first line customer services. My communication skills allowed me to excel in understanding and resolving customer queries. This was highlighted when I won the runners up award for the WOW! National Customer Service Award.


#### Teamwork
At both Collinson Tech and Zopa I collaborated with the developers so as to ensure defects and bugs were quickly raised, understood and tested prior to deployment. During my time as a QA at Collinson, I collaborated with my team to design a comprehensive test suite. Through partnering with others it became a living document, from which I received invaluable feedback, instrumental in transforming it into a clear and comprehensive suite.

- Kanban
- JIRA
- Zephyr (JIRA plugin)
